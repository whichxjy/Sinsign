It is the story of the falling rain
to turn into a leaf and fall again
it is the secret of a summer shower
to steal the light and hide it in a flower
and every flower a tiny tributary
that from the ground flows green and momentary
is one of water’s wishes and this tale
hangs in a seed-head smaller than my thumbnail
if only I a passerby could pass
as clear as water through a plume of grass
to find the sunlight hidden at the tip
turning to seed a kind of lifting rain drip
then I might know like water how to balance
the weight of hope against the light of patience
water which is so raw so earthy-strong
and lurks in cast-iron tanks and leaks along
drawn under gravity towards my tongue
to cool and fill the pipe-work of this song 
which is the story of the falling rain
that rises to the light and falls again
I ask them to take a poem
and hold it up to the light
like a color slide
or press an ear against its hive.
I say drop a mouse into a poem
and watch him probe his way out,
or walk inside the poem’s room
and feel the walls for a light switch.
I want them to water-ski
across the surface of a poem
waving at the author’s name on the shore.
But all they want to do
is tie the poem to a chair with rope
and torture a confession out of it.
They begin beating it with a hose
to find out what it really means.
you are unaware of your obscure sources
but you are explicitly sure of the vast sea
as your final destination
you always frown with your brownish wrinkles
but you prefer a nonprofessional smile on your face
your only luggage of life
all your teeth have been lost or pulled out
but you keep licking the muddy banks with your heart
despite your dreams forged
your song is no more than a foam of silence
but you struggle hard to remain afloat on the sea of noise
beyond the borderline of heaven
your love for the loess plateau often overturns and overflows
but you have never flooded the valley of the dragon’s mind
since confucius’s times
your course ahead is crowded with holes and crevices
but you will deliver your promises to every unevenness
instead of promising the deliveries only
you occupy an enormously tiny place of the world
but you feed all the hopes and wishes of those
with thirsty mouths stranded ashore
you flow down from the sky created by yourself
but you hope to avoid falling on the broken floor
of your own church
you may be tortured or burned to steam
but you will eventually find your impossible way
to the sea of blue sky
At the beginning I noticed
the huge stones on my path
I knew instinctively
why they were there
breathing as naturally
as animals
I moved them to ritual patterns
I abraded my hands
and made blood prints
Last week I became
aware of details
cubes of fool’s gold
green and blue copper
crystal formations
fossils    shell casts
iron roses     candied gems
I thought of
the Empress Josephine,
the Burning of Troy
between her breasts,
of Ivan the Terrible lecturing
on the virtues of rubies.
They were dilettantes.
By the turn of the week
I was madly in love
with stone. Do you know
how beautiful it is
to embrace stone
to curve all your body
against its surfaces?
Yesterday I began
seeing you as
desirable as a stone
I imagined you coming
onto the path with me
even your mouth
a carved stone
Today for the first time
I noticed how coarse
my skin has grown
but the stones shine
with their own light,
they grow smoother
and smoother
i ask mama
about residential school
she says no
i ask her again
she says no
the third time
i stop listen
to her silence
ask about her diabetes
her hip achy back
her sore knees
did she get her hearing aid fixed
whether she thinks it will rain tomorrow
mama talks about all this
says i'm not too good my girl
my sugar is too high
arthritis acting up that damn doctor
won’t give me any more pain pills
this hearing aid is shit
and the rain
the rain hurts
my girl
i listen to her talk
back words slow
fill her cup
with tea
sometimes I find myself
weeping
at the oddest moment
an unexpected voice
mon oncle André
calling Christmas Day
wishing me
a Merry Christmas
and I am
that little girl
walking across the lake
with her grandfather
to check on the snares
and traps he has set
in this frost
exploding moon
in surrounding islands
the frost is biting
and he motions I walk
in the shade
of his warm body
soon he claims
we will be
in the thick of brush
and we will make a fire
to warm our bodies

I have to live.
he played injun in gods country
where boys proved themselves clean
dumb beasts who could cut fire
out of the whitest sand
he played english across the trail
where girls turned plum wild
garlic and strained words
through the window of night
he spoke through numb lips and
breathed frontier
he heard snatches of comment
going up from the river bank
all them injuns is people first
and besides for this buckskin
why we even shoot at them
and seems like a sign of warm
dead as a horse friendship
and time to pedal their eyes
to lean out and say the truth
all you injuns is just white keys
some fearful heap
some crooked swell
bent towards him
and produced a pair
of nickel-plated pullers
a bull winder of
dirty tenderness
that stiffened into
that low-brow ice
that dead injun game
During two hours on the train
I rerun the film of my life
Two minutes per year on average
Half an hour for childhood
Another half-hour for prison
Love, books, wandering
take up the rest
the hand of my companion
gradually melts into mine
and her head on my shoulder
is as light as a dove
When we arrive
I’ll be fifty or so
and still have
about an hour
to live
She knots her hair
debris stuck in her curls
shredded notes
and fragments of glass
stabbing out
from her raven-pitched crown
the objects she carries
as the burden of her birth
show the cracks of labor
the dried river bed
bifurcating across her palms
the crossing
serration of stained glass
clenches the brush
as she covers the potholes of youth
years of advertising campaigns
magazine covers
anti-intellectual agendas
tainted her image
lead in the lipstick
pesticides
in her blush
a flock of ravens in her eyeliner
prayers
stuffed in her crows feet
picking at her cuticles 
as she enters the gym
hoping
no one will recognize her
when i watch you
wrapped up like garbage
sitting, surrounded by the smell
of too old potato peels
or
when i watch you
in your old man's shoes
with the little toe cut out
sitting, waiting for your mind
like next week's grocery
i say
when i watch you
you wet brown bag of a woman
who used to be the best looking gal in georgia
used to be called the Georgia Rose
i stand up 
through your destruction
i stand up
Every year without knowing it I have passed the day
When the last fires will wave to me
And the silence will set out
Tireless traveller
Like the beam of a lightless star
Then I will no longer
Find myself in life as in a strange garment
Surprised at the earth
And the love of one woman
And the shamelessness of men
As today writing after three days of rain
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
And bowing not knowing to what
Afternoon shines on your mask
Once dark bark-colored
Now masquerading as blond
Credit the bleach
For helping you fit in
With a thousand fake smiles
At a sweet sixteen
the hands on the clock keep turning
yet somehow the fire keeps burning
walking the halls he degrades into time
ruining the place with his satin-belted prime
I could have been kinder
like a tree is kind
like a rainbow
like a spoon
Kind is not the same as nice
Nice is how you act
Kind is how you help
I could have been kinder
to Melissa
who only wanted
to be looked forward to
I could have been kinder
to Steve
who didn’t understand
that friendship
isn’t asked for
love isn’t earned
I could have been kinder
the way time can be kind
to strangers
to youth
to the wounded

If this brain’s over-tempered
consider that the fire was want
and the hammers were fists.
I’ve tasted my blood too much
to love what I was born to.
But my mother’s look
was a field of brown oats, soft-bearded;
her voice rain and air rich with lilacs:
and I loved her too much to like
how she dragged her days like a sled over gravel.
Playmates? I remember where their skulls roll!
One died hungry, gnawing grey perch-planks;
one fell, and landed so hard he splashed;
and many and many
come up atom by atom
in the worm-casts of Europe.
My deep prayer a curse.
My deep prayer the promise that this won’t be.
My deep prayer my cunning,
my love, my anger,
and often even my forgiveness
that this won’t be and be.
I’ve tasted my blood too much 
to abide what I was born to.
When he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
But when I start to tell them,
They think I'm telling lies.
I say,
It's in the reach of my arms
The span of my hips,
The stride of my step,
The curl of my lips.
I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.
I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please,
And to a man,
The fellows stand or
Fall down on their knees.
Then they swarm around me,
A hive of honey bees.
I say,
It's the fire in my eyes,
And the flash of my teeth,
The swing in my waist,
And the joy in my feet.
I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.
Men themselves have wondered
What they see in me.
They try so much
But they can't touch
My inner mystery.
When I try to show them
They say they still can't see.
I say,
It's in the arch of my back,
The sun of my smile,
The ride of my breasts,
The grace of my style.
I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.
Now you understand
Just why my head's not bowed.
I don't shout or jump about
Or have to talk real loud.
When you see me passing
It ought to make you proud.
I say,
It's in the click of my heels,
The bend of my hair,
the palm of my hand,
The need of my care,
'Cause I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

grass is unusual
it was invented by the Romans
unlike most people grass stays where it grows
if grass had gone to the moon it would be there today
because grass looks luxurious
people put it wherever they can
a wedge of grass can split a sidewalk
city block, manhattan skyscraper
make a dog sick
step on grass; it deserves it
There was a time, year one thousand A.D
U.S. turkeys faced a brand new plight.
Usefulness seen.
Native American's hunting delight. 
The white meat of a turkey is quite lean.
So much healthier than man knew before,
Nothing one ever could say,
In any way,
Would make Americans free turkeys anymore.
Thanksgiving comes and goes.
Wild turkey gobbling slows.
Ben Franklin watched their plight.
Nominated, though laughter did flare.
Turkeys beneath the moonlight
Were beautiful out there.
Ben suggested, turks as the nation's bird.
But eagles know, it was not so.
And turks in history endured this nations birth.

You’ll wanna forget, but I’ll sell your kisses for a bag and a rig.
My glory rides on a brick and a gram
You’ll never get more then half my mind.
I’ll eat ya to put you to sleep 
Cause my dick won’t step up half the time.
Your eyes shut to tapping my vein
Dancing through shards of moonlight, emptying your purse.
I can score while your searching your plastic case for your pretty face.
Sweet poems and construction paper cards were pregame.  
Now I finger through  your parents drawers, quarter rolls are good enough.
Do you still crave me babe?
How’s third place, my two best buds a needle away?
Even when my eyes aren’t dotted up it isn’t fair.
Just a routine, credit card debt and jail don’t scare.  
With me we’re always in the midst of thunder
Recoveries pink clouds in front but out of grasp.  
Absence of luck permits you to hang on to my spirit embezzling tears.
I’ll be smiling at the freedom, Ignoring your texted stabs.  
Long sleeves and 50 hour work weeks fooled your parents, but 
The mirrors sunken and pale my features lost to warmth artificial from my heart.
Everything is gonna be cool as long as no one sees my arms.   
Penniless,  I’ll dissolve all my cravings under my tongue… for a week.  
Steaks marinated in Pabst followed by talks of your creation.  
We can lay in bed alll day watching Hulu and melting time.  
For once I’ll be all your’s no more rocks disrupting my brain.
As soon as pay day hits I’ll sprint out the front door.
Self knowledge equated to the encyclopedia
and perceived facts, products of personal reasoning
the efficacy of thoughts should not be questioned
and assumptions simply made real and absolute
Typical of such a thought stamps on convictions that
the banana and plantain are the same
a superior race surely exist
leg size has a great correlation with the male’s genital
the measure of one’s success is solely factored
in his accumulation of wealth
and money is the root of all evil.
This mindset can walk on hot coal just to prove these points
Columbus was the first European to visit the Americas
bulls are colour blind and bats are completely blind
women are subordinates to men
and a pure heart is one which covers its body from head to toe
This mind can even tear its clothes to rags
in displeasure to your opposition to issues such as
Sydney is Australia’s capital
the earth’s evolution is the cause of day and night
Africa is a country and its inhabitants exchange
morning greetings with the Lion and the Chimpanzee
and Neil Armstrong is the first human to journey into out space
Despite carrying the internet even to the dreams
and having global captions mixed with daily breath
assumptions such as these are nurtured
religiously, with rigidity and military acceptance
the biggest illiterate of the 21st century is one
who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn
so said Alvin Toffler, the Australian Educationist.
Oh sorry! The American futurist
For some time the old ones gazed that way,
When there came a seer,
A man named Wovoka.
Who told them he had heard their voices calling in the night to him,
That voices spoke to him of better times soon to come,
That might be brought forth by a special way and a special dance
That would bring to birth a stronger magic than that of Progress,
That would dispel the evil changes.
They listened and they took heart
With the pitiful fervor of the desperate.
He taught his new believers his way and his dance,
And for a time,
A fragile time in their trembling twilight
The sacred songs and their meaning returned to the silent brown lands,
And a joy was felt and shone in the proud faces of the faithful, 
And the long lines worn of care cracked and smoothed to smiles.
The young know nothing of these things now,
Nor do they care to know.
Their lives are resigned to the long slow fade.
But the old, huddling close to their quiet cares,
And closer still to the quiet face of death in the shadows of their rooms,
Feel the spirit of a former time lying still upon their hearts,
A thing beyond the shallow grasp of youth.
They sit stonily, unmoved in their fogs, remembering tales.
And when no one looks,
They turn their failing eyes back to the red mesas
And recall the Dance of the Ghosts.
Every now and then, I think of days gone by
I remember long summer days, climbing in the hills
I remember warm nights, counting the stars in the sky
Things we did as children, not so long ago
Every now and then, I think of you
The eyes that seemed to look deeply into my soul
The smile that would keep me warm on a cool day
The silliness we were able to share without fear
The heartbreaks we suffered through as young lovers do
Things we did as young lovers, not so long ago
Every now and then, I remember those little faces
My children, who looked to me for everything
Those loving faces that thought I could do no wrong
Those little arms that would envelope me at a moment’s notice
The things I remember as a mommy, no so long ago
Every now and then, I remember how we grew together as one
The difficult times when I wasn’t sure we would make it through
The good times when I didn’t know what I would do without you
The tender moments alone, no words needed to be said
The things we did as we were growing older together
Every now and then I miss those days
I feel an urge to run outside in the rain
I yearn to sit up on the hillside and look over my world
For the scraped knees and the broken hearted moments
To swing you in the air and listen to your giggles
To love with reckless abandon
Every now and then I go back and visit those days
Now, we still have each other and with a little luck 
There will be many more now and then moments to share 
I don’t sleep Georgia
I shoot bullets into the dark
the blunt mimeographic dark
the middle dark Georgia
outside the outside
whatever a ghost’s front tooth is Georgia
let alone ballistics
whatever pulls back the hammer Georgia
coughing up sulfur and strobes of negate
I wait Georgia
think Georgia
the fire is like the snow Georgia
the snow wipes out a oneway street puts nothing in its place
snow is not like the snow Georgia
one is theorem the other will thaw
night is the neighbor girl
she hangs her laundry
she sits on the step
the leaves on the tree in her yard are like florins
her sliding door dress in a squall Georgia
her flowers what is a flower Georgia
